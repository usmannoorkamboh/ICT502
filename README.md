Through the ICT502 Internet and Web Development course at Sydney International School of Technology and Commerce, I have gained a solid foundation in web development skills, particularly in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This week, I focused on JavaScript objects, events, and arrays, which are crucial for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. The coding exercises and lectures helped me understand how to manipulate the DOM and manage data effectively using JavaScript.
By participating in group presentations, I have significantly enhanced my research, presentation, teamwork, and coding abilities. These skills were particularly important as we tackled complex web development tasks, ensuring our code was both functional and optimized. The practical experience in publishing websites further solidified my ability to develop and deploy web applications.
